/  CDF V3.6.3.1 Release Notes       /
/-----------------------------------/

1. Compatibility with all CDF 3.*, 2.7.6 and earlier versions

CDF V3.6.3 is backward compatible with the previous versions of CDF, and it 
can read CDF files that were created with earlier versions.

If a file was created with CDF 2.7 and read and modified by CDF 3.*, the 
resultant file will be saved in the CDF 2.7 format, not CDF 3.*.  The same 
principle applies to files that were created with CDF 2.5 and 2.6.  CDF 
files that are created from scratch with CDF V3.6.3 are compatible in file
structure with all CDF 3.*, but not compatible (due to a 64-bit file offsets
used since CDF 3.0 versions) with CDF 2.7.2 or earlier, and an attempt to
read CDF 3.* files from CDF 2.7.2 or earlier will produce an error. Since a
couple of new data types were added in V3.4, applications based on V3.3.*
and earlier will not be able access the V3.4 and later files if the files 
have the data of those new types. However, if the files of V3.4 and later do 
not contain data of the new data types, V3.*-based applications should have no 
problems accessing them.   

Users of CDF 3.0 or later versions will be able to create CDF files that 
can be read by CDF 2.7.2 or earlier by using the CDFsetFileBackward function 
(in C) or CDF_set_FileBackward subroutine  (in Fortran), or using the
CDF_FILEBACKWARD environment variable on Unix/Linux (including Mac OS X) or 
PC, or CDF$FILEBACKWARD on OpenVMS.  See Section 4.18 of the CDF C 
Reference Manual and the CDF Fortran Reference Manual for details on how to 
create CDF 2.7-compatible files. Note: There are a few new data types that are
only available in Version 3.1 and later, which can not be used in Version 2.*.

All features added to the previous releases are included. Refer to the release 
notes from the previous versions to view the specific features pertaining
to that release.

2. Changes

The following changes have been made/added in V3.6.3.*:

   * If adding data to a master file to create a new CDF, the leap second last
     updated header field is updated with the information from the leap second
     table. 
   * Added a new leap second for 1/1/2017.
   * Added a new set of CDFread functions that will allocate the needed
     space for the user. It is user's responsiblility to free the space after
     use.
   * New features were added in the cdfconvert, cdfdump tool programs.
   * Modified library to space(s) filled string data that has a shorter
     length than the defined (number of elements) while reading/writing.
   * Modified Makefile and installation for Mac OS X El Captain (10.11).
   * Used the preserved system temporary folder, e.g., /tmp for Linux/Unix/MacOSX,
     to hold the temporary file(s).
   * Set temporary file name using the random number generator with process id
     and current time as the seed. 
   * Added support for computing TT2000 from UTC if the passed day is DOY
     (day of the year from January 1st).
   * Added a few options to cdfconvert tool program.
   * Added a new leap second for 2015-07-01 to the leap second table.
   * Added a new field "leapsecondlastupdated" in a CDF's GDR. This records
     the leap second table a CDF is based upon. A set of read/write/validate
     functions for the field is added to the library.
   * Added a new record delete option in the library, which will rearrange
     remaining records for sparse record variables.
   * Skipped checking the given CDF file name for ASCII for reading. Only
     enforce the file name to be ASCII, but not the directory portion, if
     provided, for creating a CDF.
   * Tool cdfconvert has a new option to sort the keyed variable, e.g., Epoch,
     for the output file.
   * Tool cdfconvert has a new option to validate a CDF, including the 
     variable data.
   * A few bugs were fixed.
   * Rename all CDF distributed MATLAB modules, prefixing each with "spdf", to
     differentiate them with the ones come from MATLAB.

Please refer to CHANGES.txt for the detailed code changes in various versions.
